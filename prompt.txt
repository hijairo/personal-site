Build a complete personal website with clean, modern design. Use HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript. Make the site fully responsive for mobile and desktop. Follow these requirements:

1. Structure
Create the following pages or sections in a single-page layout with smooth scrolling:

Home / Hero Section with a headline, subheadline, and call-to-action button.
About Section with a short bio, skills list, and a photo placeholder.
Services Section listing the services I offer (automation, AI tools, web tools, scrapers, chatbots).
Portfolio Section with 4–6 project cards (use placeholder images and text).
Contact Section with a working contact form (name, email, message).
Footer with links and copyright.

2. Design Requirements

Use a clean, modern, professional style.
Use a bold, readable font for headings and a simple font for body text.
Use a dark theme or light theme based on what looks more modern.
Add smooth hover effects on buttons and project cards.
Add simple fade-in animations on scroll.
Make spacing consistent and the layout balanced.

3. Technical Requirements

Write all code in separate files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`.
Make the site load fast and keep code organized and easy to edit.
Add SEO meta tags (title, description, keywords).
Build a responsive navigation bar that turns into a hamburger menu on mobile.
Make the contact form functional using a simple email service like Formspree.
Add comments explaining each major section of code.

4. Content Requirements
Use placeholder text that I can replace later:

Replace all personal text with generic labels like “[Your Name]”, “[Your Bio]”, “[Your Skills]”.
Write brief, clear descriptions for each service using common words.
Write short, simple descriptions for each portfolio project.
Add a clear call to action in the hero section: “Hire Me” or “Work With Me”.

5. Final Output

Generate the full website structure.
Provide all code for the HTML, CSS, and JS files.
Make sure everything works together as a complete, ready-to-deploy website.
After generating the code, show a simple checklist for deployment to Netlify or Vercel.
